# I'm learning about Docker!

I want to write a Go example that uses Go routines to *collect some kind of data from somewhere* using an unbuffered channel.

I want this Go code to run in a Docker container.

Future upgrades?
- Another Docker container running a simple database to store results.
- Do more stuff with Kubernetes (mulitple data "gatherers")
